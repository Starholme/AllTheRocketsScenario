# AllTheRocketsScenario
All The Rockets is a 'near vanilla' experience aiming to launch tens of thousands of rockets, be new player friendly, and foster cooperation
among players. This is a pure co-op, with no supported PVP.

As factorio maps grow too large to download and run, new maps will be launched. Running on a clusterio

This custom scenario adds:
- Separate spawn locations in multiplayer
- A coin shop full of various goodies
- Tools to help reduce map size

Thank you for keeping this open source, allowing others to share and adapt what you do.

Clusterio - While this scenario does not require clusterio, I still want to thank them for a system that will allow this sort of long
running game, with communication between factorio servers. https://github.com/clusterio/factorioClusterio
